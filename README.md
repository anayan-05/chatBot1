# Local CLI Chatbot using Hugging Face (flan-t5-large)

A fully offline, command-line chatbot built using Hugging Face's `flan-t5-large` model. This bot can answer factual questions (e.g., "What is the capital of France?") using local inference â€” no internet or APIs required after model download. It runs entirely on CPU, with a simple and clean interface designed for multi-turn conversations.
